      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>The primary purpose of the application is sports activity, so sports images are highlighted.</li>
        <li>Date and time icons were brought to the forefront.</li>
        <li>A user-friendly interface was aimed at being designed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Old Version UI</h4>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b014b9c-f661-4886-9bdf-5543adbcfb7b" alt="Feature 2" width="300"/>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>In the old interface, the sports icon was very small and did not fully reflect the application's purpose.</li>
        <li>The application had very little white space, which could offer users a boring experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>New Version UI-2</h4>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa603860-242d-45d1-b63f-d8c5da2af697" alt="Feature 3" width="300"/>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>The number of people registered for sports is limited to 4 profile pictures, creating curiosity and encouraging users to explore and stay on the app.</li>
        <li>To design a usable and useful interface, long texts were replaced with an 'Event Title' heading that could be described with just a button -'Click to Join'.</li>
        <li>The event creation button was designed to fit the app's iconography framework.</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>In the old version, the 'Event Title' was a long text inviting users to the created event.</li>
        <li>Since the text was long and could be boring for most users, there was a high possibility of reducing the time spent in the app.</li>
      </ul>
